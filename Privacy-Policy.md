**Privacy Policy**  
Effective Date: 19 Nov 2025  

**Data Collection**  
Bloom Scroll does not collect, store, or share personal data. Analysis happens in your browser to determine whether LinkedIn posts match your filtering criteria. No login credentials, account information, or browsing history are collected.  

**API Usage**  
When analysis is enabled:  
- The text content of LinkedIn posts may be sent to your configured AI provider’s API to classify content.
- Your API key is stored locally using the browser’s storage and is not transmitted to any service other than the AI provider you configure.
- The extension does not retain analyzed content after processing.  

**Third‑Party Services**  
Bloom Scroll can use a third‑party AI provider (currently X.AI’s Grok models) to analyze posts per your settings. Please review the AI provider’s privacy policy for details on their data handling practices.  

**Permissions**  
- **storage**: Saves your preferences (e.g., filter mode, muted words, API key).  
Content scripts run only on LinkedIn feed pages as defined in the extension configuration.  

**Security**  
- No remote executable code is fetched or run.  
- Only the minimum data necessary for content classification is sent to the configured AI provider.  
- All preferences remain stored locally in your browser.
